<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Keep track of all the players on your soccer team in one place. As team manager, it can be difficult to set the lineup for every game, remember who can and can't show up to games at certain times and days of the week, and inform players of upcoming games. This program lets you add, delete, and update player information. Sort players by their preferred postion. Take notes to remember important facts about each person, such as injuries, or recurring scheduling habits.</p>
